# air-quality-REST-SWAGGER-springboot

Hello,

this is my application, which one is extending the Polish's API of air-quality data in our country. 

I extend:
  - getting all stations belong to given city
  - getting details of air quality from stations belong to given city ( the entites were distracted ) 
  - i made my own class which hold IMO most important informations about single station

which gaves me:
  - easier way to communicate with my other MVC application
